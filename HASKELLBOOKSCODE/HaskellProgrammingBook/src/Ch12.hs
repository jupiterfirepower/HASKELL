    HKT are types that take types as arguments, like higher order functions.
    Haskell Report calls HKT "type constructors"
    Haskell Report calls fully applied types "type constants"

    * is the kind of all standard lifted types.
    unlifted types are of kind # and represent mostly pointers and native machine types

    type constructors are just functions, and can be used like functions
