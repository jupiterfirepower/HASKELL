# Haskell Programming: from first principles

These are my solutions to the [haskellbook](http://haskellbook.com). Mostly, the solutions were put in `src/ChXX.hs`. Some of the solutions per chapter were split up so I didn't have overlapping implementations.

The projects in the book which are separate applications all have their own subfolders, such as `hangman` or `morse`.

I don't have solutions for anything before Chapter 9, mostly because I already knew a bit of Haskell coming into this and those chapters were very easy.

I hope these solutions are of use to someone, feel free to PR if you come across any errors.

# Extra

I've used this repo for some additional Haskell learning. 

`typelevel` has some basic type level programming with functional dependencies, type families, GADTS, etc. 

`go-haskell` are the exercises from [A Tour of Go in Haskell](https://a-tour-of-go-in-haskell.syocy.net/en_US/index.html) which was a interesting little book of Go-like idioms in Haskell.
