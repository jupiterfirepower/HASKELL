# Shopping Cart

In this recipe, we will be creating a shopping cart for books. The books are uniquely identified by ISBN numbers. If we add same item, in the shopping cart, we should be able to update existing item or insert a new item in the shopping cart. We will be using Set as a container for shopping items.
